        <h2>Likes</h2>
        <p>I mostly like doing GameDev & WebDev as a hobby. I also LOVE watching anime like Demon Slayer, Solo Leveling, Tokyo Ghoul & many more. I love to chat as well with my friends and others. When I get bored I even make YouTube videos. I'm a big video game nerd who plays any kind of game you suggest me as long as it's supported on my PC cuz my PC is kind of potato. LOL!</p>
        
        <h2>Dislikes</h2>
        <p>I don't got that many dislikes. I hate racism and judging people by their faces and religions. Don't like bullying and shit along with horny people who make sexual jokes.</p>
